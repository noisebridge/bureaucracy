Community working group
=======================

This is the charter for the Noisebridge community working group (the CWG).

The CWG is responsible for the integrity and safety of the Noisebridge community. It is the primary venue to resolve inter-personal disputes or to report bad behavior.


Code of conduct
===============

The CWG is responsible for editing, and maintaining Noisebridge's anti-harassment policy (AHP).

The purpose of the AHP is to help make Noisebridge a space where everyone is safe and valued, regardless of background, identity, or experience.

The AHP must describe required and prohibited behavior and practices, and repercussions for violations.

The AHP may extend to behavior in both physical and virtual spaces, and to events, times, places, acts, and activities related to Noisebridge even if they do not occur in Noisebridge's spaces.

The CWG is responsible for ensuring that the AHP is well-known and broadly understood by the Noisebridge community.


Reporting
=========

The CWG is responsible for creating mechanisms for reporting harassment, violations of the AHP, other bad behavior, and inter-personal disputes.

The CWG shall ensure that this reporting mechanism is widely accessible to members of the Noisebridge community, and that members of the Noisebridge community feel safe using it.

The CWG shall be responsible for setting appropriate safeguards regarding confidentiality and integrity of reports, and respect for those who make reports.


Disputes
========

The CWG is responsible for administering a process to adjudicate disputes between members of the Noisebridge community.

The CWG dispute-adjudication process shall be fair to its participants, and administered in a way which protects and keeps safe vulnerable participants.

The CWG dispute-adjudication process shall be applicable to disputes of various severities.


Repercussions

The CWG is responsible for defining a schedule of such repercussions, and a mechanism for assigning them.

The CWG has the authority to suspend or terminate Noisebridge membership, participation in Noisebridge's council or board, or the role of an officer.

The CWG has the authority to bar a person from Noisebridge's physical and virtual spaces, or to place additional requirements or restrictions on a person's participation in Noisebridge.

The board has no obligation to hear an appeal.

A board-member who has been suspended or terminated by the CWG may not participate in any appeals.
