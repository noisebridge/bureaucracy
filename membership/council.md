Appplication
============

1. Fill out top part of an application form. There should be blank forms in the membership binder, or you can print your own.
2. Put your completed application form in the binder at the space.
3. Persuade two current full Noisebridge council-members to sponsor your application by signing your application form.
4. Every meeting, there is a standing agenda item to read all the applications in the binder. You do not have to be present when your application is read.
5. Once your application has been read out at four meetings, and you have obtained two sponsors, you are up for approval.
6. During that meeting you may request that Noisebridge consents to have you become a member of the council, but you may put this off until the next meeting (or the next &c.). If you are unable to attend meetings, another member may proxy your request.
7. During the meeting at which you request that Noisebridge consents to have you become a member, those present may ask you (or your proxy) questions.
8. After those present are finished asking questions, you are asked to leave the room, and your application is discussed without you present. The meeting may then choose to agree to have you become a member of Noisebridge. 

Once Noisebridge has agreed to have you as a member you have two things to do:

* Fill out your contact information and give the secretary your application form.
* Make sure that your wiki user page is updated with the `[[Category:Council]]`.

At the very least, the secretary needs this information.

* email address
* wiki username
