Being a member of the Noisebridge council is not like being a regular member. Lots of folks come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a member of the council for that. At Noisebridge, the council is something more: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a member of the Noisebridge council, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community better than it is today.

Appplication
============

Noisbridge's council are the only folks in our community who are empowered to fully participate in Noisebridge's consensus process. This is a heady and awesome responsibility, and it is likewise an involved process to become a council-member. Here's how it goes

1. Fill out top part of an application form. There should be blank forms in the membership binder, or you can print your own.
2. Put your completed application form in the binder at the space.
3. Persuade two current full Noisebridge council-members to sponsor your application by signing your application form.
4. Every meeting, there is a standing agenda item to read all the applications in the binder. You do not have to be present when your application is read.
5. Once your application has been read out at four meetings, and you have obtained two sponsors, you are up for approval.
6. During that meeting you may request that Noisebridge consents to have you become a member of the council, but you may put this off until the next meeting (or the next &c.). If you are unable to attend meetings, another member may proxy your request.
7. During the meeting at which you request that Noisebridge consents to have you become a member, those present may ask you (or your proxy) questions.
8. After those present are finished asking questions, you are asked to leave the room, and your application is discussed without you present. The meeting may then choose to agree to have you become a member of Noisebridge. 

If you leave your paper council-membership application form in the binder for more than twelve weeks, it'll be be discarded. If you still wants to become a council-member, you'll have to start the application process over from scratch. 

Once Noisebridge has agreed to have you as a member you have two things to do:

* Fill out your contact information and give the secretary your application form.
* Make sure that your wiki user page is updated with the `[[Category:Council]]`.

At the very least, the secretary needs this information.

* email address
* wiki username

Other useful information includes the following.

* IRC nickname
* Github username
* Twitter handle
* GPG fingerprint

Once you have done both these things, you are entitled to full participation in Noisebridge's consensus process.

At any time, anyone can look in the binder and peruse the applications. If an existing council-member has any concerns with any of the applicants, they should take time during that month to try and resolve the problem. They may ask another member to be a proxy for them to either help resolve the problem (preferred) or to voice their objection at the approval meeting.
