 Being a member of the Noisebridge council means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. The council don't just come to Noisebridge to hack and learn, but actively work to improve what they see around them, help to deal with problems, and make this community better than it is today.

Appplication
============

Noisbridge's council are the only folks in our community who are empowered to fully participate in Noisebridge's consensus process. This is a significant responsibility, and it is likewise an involved process to become a council-member. Only existing members are eligible to join the council.

The applicant must fill out an application form and places it in the membership binder. Existing council-members may sponsor an applicant by signing their application form. At each [community meeting](../meetings.md) the names and sponsors of all current council applicants are read. If an applicant's name has been read at at least four meetings, and two current council-members sponsor them, they are eligible for approval. 

During the council-membership section of a community meeting, the an applicant who is eligible for approval may ask to join the council. Others present at the meeting have the opportunity to interview the applicant. The applicant is then asked to leave the room while their application is discussed. Neither the interview nor subsequent conversation are recorded in the meeting notes. An applicant may choose to send a proxy in their place for this process.

Following the discussion, council-members present at the meeting decide whether to approve the application. This decision is made my consensus, and recorded in the meeting notes.

If a council application has been in the membership binder for twelve weeks, it is discarded at the next community meeting. That applicant would have to start the process from the beginning.


Responsibilities
================

After a successful application, the new council-member must update their wiki user page to include the `[[Category:Council]]` tag, convey their completed application form to the secretary and provide the secretary with some contact information:
