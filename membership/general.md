There are two categories of members at Noisebridge: [members](./members.md) and the [Noisebridge council](./council.md). It is not a secret whether a person is a member of Noisebridge or of the Noisebridge council.

It is the responsibility of all users of Noisebridge (guests, members, and council-members) to contribute to Noisebridge as they are able. An individual's contribution should be proportionate with that person's use of Noisebridge and its resources. A reasonable monetary contribution from a member or associate member may be $80 per month, but it is each person's responsibility to determine what contribution is reasonable for them.

It is the responsibility of each member to identify themself by adding the `[[Category:Members]]` tag to their wiki user page. Council-members must also add the `[[Category:Council]]` tag. Until a member does, they shall not be entitled to any privilege of Noisebridge membership or council-membership. Although it shall generally be a responsibility shared by all members to ensure that this category of identification is used correctly, in cases where its use is disputed, Noisebridge's secretary shall be the final arbiter.
