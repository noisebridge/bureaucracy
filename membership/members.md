Being a member of Noisebridge is a lot like being a member of a gym or a chess club. Members can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn whenever they want. Members can bring their friends, colleagues, and collaborators to Noisebridge to work on projects with them.

Application
===========

Becoming an member is relatively straightforward, and can be done entirely online.

First, you should create an account on the [Noisebridge wiki](https://www.noisebridge.net/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&type=signup&returnto=Noisebridge), edit your user page to introduce yourself and add the `[[Category:Applicant]]` tag to it. You can use whatever name you like, and tell us as much or as little about you as you'd like. Folks still need to know you when they meet you at Noisebridge though, so if you use an opaque pseudonym, you might have to introduce yourself a lot in person. For examples of how folks like to introduce themselves, you could check out the wiki pages of some existing members.

Once you have your wiki page, you need to get four people to sponsor you. They do this by logging in, editing your wiki user page and adding a little note that they're vouching for you. The people who can sponsor you are:

* any council member, or
* any member who didn't become a member since the last Tuesday meeting. 

Once four folks have added a note of support on your wiki user page, you can change your `[[Category:Applicant]]` tag to a `[[Category:Members]]` tag and you're done, congrats! You become an member as soon as you've added the category, which means that you can come to the space whenever you'd like, and bring folks with you. However, you can't sponsor other folks until a Tuesday meeting has passed since you became an member.

Now would be a good time to make sure you've introduced yourself on IRC, at a Tuesday meeting, and on the discussion list; joined other mailing lists you'd like, ask for an account on some of Noisebridge's shared machines, sign GPG keys with folks, or ask someone to set you up with a door code. Happy hacking!
