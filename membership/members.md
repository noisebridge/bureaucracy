Members are Noisebridge's bread and butter. These are the folks who make up the backbone of our community.

Members can come to Noisebridge to hack and learn whenever they want. Members can bring their friends, colleagues, and collaborators to Noisebridge to work on projects with them.


Application
===========

Becoming a member is done online, using the Noisebridge wiki.

First, a prospective member should create an account on the [Noisebridge wiki](https://www.noisebridge.net/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&type=signup&returnto=Noisebridge) and the `[[Category:Applicant]]` tag to their wiki user page.

Although folks are welcome to use a pseudonym as their wiki username, they're encourages to fill out their wiki user page with a little information about them. Others need to know that which actual people belong to which user pages. Inspiration for filling out user pages can be found on the pages of [existing members](https://www.noisebridge.net/Category%3AMembers)

To become a member, four existing members must sponsor the applicant. The sponsors must log into their wiki account and add a note to the applicant's user page noting the endorsement. Only someone who has been a member since the most recent [community meeting](../meetings.md) are elegible to sponsor new members.

Once there are four endorsements, the prospective member should change their `[[Category:Applicant]]` tag to a `[[Category:Members]]` tag. They become a member as soon as they change the category.


Notes
=====

Although dues are not a condition of membership, everyone is responsible for contributing to Noisebridge as they are able. An individual's contribution should be proportionate with that person's use of Noisebridge and its resources. A reasonable monetary contribution from a member may be $80 per month, but it is each person's responsibility to determine what contribution is reasonable for them.
