<!-- Name : Fair Usage Policy -->

Noisebridge supports fair usage.

Personal use
------------
Noisebridge is a hackerspace, not anyone's home. It is not acceptable to live at Noisebridge.  

The determination of what is over usage shall be made by Noisebridge based on the totality of circumstances.  In determining if an individual is over using the space Noisebridge may consider the individual's history, active projects and contributions to the space.  Noisebridge shall remain cognizant that the core purpose of Noisebridge is as a hackerspace, and is encouraged to craft solutions fitted to the individual.  For example Noisebridge might decide that:

	an individual who was asleep at Noisebridge shall only use the space between 10 am and 10 pm  

	an individual who has problematic kitchen usage, shall for a period not be permitted to use the kitchen or eat within Noisebridge.

Sleeping
--------

People shall not sleep at Noisebridge.   

Users may email the secretary@noisebridge.org about persons who are sleeping or appear to be sleeping at Noisebridge. 

If an individual's sleep at Noisebridge impacts other users use and comfort, the individual may be asked to leave.

Kitchen Usage and Food
----------------------

People who use the kitchen are responsible to clean.

Food should not be left out at Noisebridge. If someone brings food to Noisebridge it is their responsibility to ensure that the space is cleaned, and that no food is left out.

An individual may be asked to leave for improper kitchen usage and food matters at Noisebridge.   Alternatively, users may email the secretary@noisebridge.org about kitchen usage and food matters.

Storage
-------

Noisebridge is not for the general storage of personal possessions. The only items which should be stored at Noisebridge are projects which are in progress, and the tools, parts, &c. for those projects. The proper storage for these items are the lockers or the hacker shelves.   

Users may email the secretary@noisebridge.org about unacceptable storage.

Out of bounds
-------------

The basement, the roof, and the fire escape are out of bounds. Do not go to these places except to use the fire escape in an emergency, and absolutely do not store items there. The dark room is to be only used for film development. The server room is only to be used for server related purposes. The stairwell and elevator are only for access to Noisebridge. People should not loiter in these locations.

Using the out of bounds space can have serious consequences, therefore, users are warned that Noisebridge may consider permanent banning for even the first time out of bounds usage incident.

If you wish to stand outside Noisebridge, keep at least ten feet from the front gate. Do not obstruct access to Noisebridge or our neighbors to either side. If you smoke outside Noisebridge, ensure that you do not inconvenience our neighbors or those trying to access Noisebridge.

Requests to leave
-----------------

Any person at Noisebridge is empowered to instruct another to leave at any time. Such an instruction should only be given if the recipient's behavior is or has been unacceptable. The recipient shall immediately gather their belongings and depart. Within 24 hours, the asker should email secretary@noisebridge.org explaining the situation and these events.  After using reasonable judgment the secretary personnel should normally email the discuss list a summary that a person was asked to leave for a reason.

Prior to returning to the space the person asked to leave shall email secretary@noisebridge.org explaining the situation and these events OR attend a Tuesday meeting OR attend a community working group meeting and explain the situation and these events. In every case someone who has been asked to leave shall not return for at least 24 hours. 

Failure to depart when asked OR returning to the space prematurely is a serious offense that can lead to a permanent banning.

Nobody is ever required to ask another to leave and nobody should ever confront a someone else who they think poses a physical danger to their safety.

Fair Usage
----------
This policy shall  be known as the Noisebridge fair usage policy.
