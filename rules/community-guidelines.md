Community Guidelines
====================

Noisebridge supports fair usage. We agree as participants of Noisebridge to be excellent.

2169 Use
--------

Noisebridge shares a building with other tenants. The following guidelines outline best practices for sharing space with our neighbors.

* Do not service the elevator. Doing so conflicts with an agreement that we have with our landlord. Elevator issues should be reported to building management via the secretary@noisebridge.net alias.

* The roof is not apart of Noisebridge.

* The basement is not a part of Noisebridge.

* The back stairwell is not a part of Noisebridge.

* The fire escape is to be used only in case of an emergency.

* Going anywhere noted above, except in narrow circumstances that you almost certainly aren't covered by, jeopardizes our continued tenancy.

Personal Use
------------

We agree that Noisebridge is an infrastructure provider for technical-creative projects. We teach, we learn, we share. The following guidelines outline best practices for using and maintaining our shared hackerspace.

* Noisebridge is your hackerspace, not your home. Overuse/abuse is an anti-pattern within the community.

* Noisebridge has designated space for project storage. Failure to store and label your project in a designated space may result in unexpected hacks. If you are unaware of what spaces are designated for project storage, then please ask someone or consult the wiki.

* Pull your own weight. We don't have housekeeping service, so clean up after yourself and put things away when you're done. In fact, you're going to get a lot of good karma by tidying up twice the amount of space you use on a regular basis. Washing dishes, answering the door/phone, taking out the garbage, giving tours are great. Each one, teach one.

* Noisebridge operates as a Do-ocracy; if you want something done, do it. Most of the time many of us just don't want to be troubled with spending a week figuring out if everyone is ok with a small or mundane thing. The biggest challenge in a do-acracy is ascertaining (and taking) responsibility. If someone undoes a do-acratic change, then more discussion is encouraged before any further changes are made.
